**AI Code Guard**
Lightweight AI-Powered Security Reviews for GitHub Pull Requests

AI Code Guard is a simple, developer-friendly GitHub Action that automatically reviews pull requests for common security issues.
It analyzes only the PR diff and posts a clear, actionable security comment.


**Features**
Security-focused AI code review. No style comments. No nitpicks. Only real security findings.

Detects common vulnerability patterns

- Hard-coded secrets

- Insecure authentication / authorization

- SQL injection-style patterns

- XSS-prone cookie usage

- Open redirect behavior

- Sensitive data logging

- Missing input validation

- Unsafe error handling

- Insecure headers / missing TLS

- Basic API misuse patterns

- And more…


**Installation**

In your repository, create the file:

.github/workflows/ai-code-guard.yml


Add the following:

```yaml
name: AI Code Guard

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run AI Code Guard
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: npm run review-pr

```
Add your repository secrets in GitHub:

OPENAI_API_KEY → from OpenAI dashboard

GITHUB_TOKEN → already provided by GitHub (no action needed)


**Usage**

Once the workflow is installed:

- Every PR triggers an automated security review

- Only the changed lines are analyzed
- The bot posts a single clean comment with:

   Title

   Risks

   File-specific findings

   Fix suggestions

- Nothing blocks merges unless you configure branch protection.


**Example Output**
```yaml
🔐 AI Code Guard Security Review

1. Hard-coded Secrets
File: config.js
Risk: API key exposed in git history.
Fix: Move to environment variables or a secret manager.

2. Insecure Logging
File: login.js
Risk: Printing user passwords into logs.
Fix: Remove password field or mask it.

```

**How It Works**

- GitHub Action extracts PR diffs

- Sends changes (safely truncated) to the AI model

- AI analyzes code for real-world security issues

- A structured comment is posted to the PR

No infrastructure or backend needed
